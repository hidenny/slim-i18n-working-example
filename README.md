## slim-i18n-working-example

after hours of searching and testing and failing
I can't find a good working example of gettext translation
that work on my machine
there difference with working with gettext in apache under windows

this example use Slim framework plus Twig template engine

index.twig
``` html
{% trans %}Hello, {{ name }}, it is nice to see you today!{% endtrans %}
```
